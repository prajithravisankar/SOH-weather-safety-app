## 🌟 **What is SafeGuard?**

SafeGuard is a comprehensive weather safety platform that combines **real-time disaster monitoring** with **personal location management** to keep you and your loved ones safe during emergencies. In an era of increasing natural disasters and climate uncertainty, SafeGuard bridges the gap between scattered weather apps and personal safety management.

## 🎯 **The Problem We Solve**

**Traditional weather apps tell you what's happening, but not how it affects the people and places you care about.**

- 📱 **Scattered Information**: Weather data, location tracking, and emergency contacts exist in separate apps
- ⏰ **Delayed Awareness**: Learning about threats to your loved ones' locations after it's too late  
- 🗺️ **No Unified View**: No single platform showing both real-time disasters AND your important locations
- 👥 **Isolation During Emergencies**: Difficulty coordinating safety across multiple locations and family members
- 📍 **Generic Alerts**: Weather warnings that don't consider your specific locations and circumstances

## ✨ **Our Solution**

SafeGuard creates a **unified safety command center** that monitors threats in real-time while keeping track of all the locations that matter to you.

### 🔥 **Core Features**

🗺️ **Interactive Safety Map**
- Real-time disaster tracking using NASA's EONET API (earthquakes, wildfires, storms, floods)
- Weather overlay integration with OpenWeatherMap
- Click anywhere to get precise GPS coordinates
- Visual representation of threats relative to your saved locations

📍 **Smart Location Management** 
- Save unlimited locations (home, work, family, friends) with custom details
- Each location includes member names, contact info, and place types
- User-specific data isolation - your locations stay private
- Address-to-coordinate conversion with intelligent suggestions

🎯 **Intelligent Proximity Search**
- Click any location to find nearest threats or safe zones
- Animated radial search expanding outward until matches are found
- Distance calculations using precise geographic algorithms
- Visual connection lines showing threat-to-location relationships

👤 **Personal Safety Network**
- Individual user accounts with secure authentication
- Private location storage per user
- Persistent sessions for quick access during emergencies
- Clean, stress-free interface designed for high-pressure situations

📱 **Universal Responsiveness**
- Full desktop experience with side-by-side map and controls
- Mobile-optimized touch interface for on-the-go monitoring  
- Adaptive layouts that scale from smartphones to ultrawide displays

> **Note:** For MVP and rapid prototyping, we are using mock data (see `mock-data/disasters.json` and similar files) for disaster events and locations wherever necessary. This allows us to build and test the UI and core flows quickly. Real API integration will be added after the MVP is functional and tested.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### 📥 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prajithravisankar/SOH-weather-safety-app.git
   cd SOH-weather-safety-app
   ```

2. **Set up Environment Variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   touch .env
   ```
   
   Add your API keys to the `.env` file:
   ```env
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key_here
   PORT=5050
   ```
   
   Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   touch .env
   ```
   
   Add the following to the frontend `.env`:
   ```env
   VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   
   **Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
   
   **Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

### ▶️ Running the Application

You need to run both the backend server and frontend development server simultaneously.

#### Option 1: Using Two Terminals (Recommended)

**Terminal 1 - Backend Server:**
```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```
You should see: `Server running on http://localhost:5050`

**Terminal 2 - Frontend Development Server:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
You should see: `Local: http://localhost:5173/`

#### Option 2: Using Background Process
```bash
# Start backend in background
cd backend && node server.js &

# Start frontend in foreground
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### 🌐 Accessing the Application

1. **Open your browser** and navigate to: `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Create an account** or login with existing credentials
3. **Start adding locations** and exploring disaster data on the interactive map!

### 🛠️ API Keys Setup

To get full functionality, you'll need an OpenWeatherMap API key:

1. **Sign up** at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. **Generate a free API key**
3. **Add the key** to both `.env` files as shown above

**Note:** The app will work without API keys using mock data, but weather overlays won't be available.

### 📱 Testing Different Devices

- **Desktop:** Full responsive layout with side-by-side map and location list
- **Mobile:** Stacked layout optimized for touch interactions
- **Tablet:** Adaptive layout that scales between mobile and desktop views

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Port already in use:**
   - Backend: Change `PORT=5050` to another port in `backend/.env`
   - Frontend: Vite will automatically suggest an alternative port

2. **Dependencies not found:**
   ```bash
   # Clear cache and reinstall
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

3. **API errors:**
   - Check that your OpenWeatherMap API key is valid
   - Ensure both `.env` files have the correct API key format

4. **Map not loading:**
   - Verify internet connection (required for map tiles)
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
