### EONET-Compatible Mock Data for Disasters (Post 3.3.1)
- Refactored `mock-data/disasters.json` to match the EONET API structure (id, title, description, categories, geometry, etc.).
- Added 2â€“3 mock events for each EONET category, with realistic coordinates and dates.
- This approach ensures seamless transition to the real NASA EONET API with minimal code changes.
- Frontend and backend can now parse and display disaster events using the same data contract as the live API.

### Sub-todo 4.1.1: Create LocationForm component and persist locations in file
- Implemented LocationForm in frontend with fields for name, latitude, longitude, and submit button.
- Backend `/api/locations` now reads/writes to `mock-data/members.json` for all GET/POST/DELETE.
- Verified with Postman and frontend: new locations are saved to file and returned by API.
- Removed in-memory array from backend route; all location data is now file-based for MVP persistence.


Date: June 29, 2025, 3:40 PM IST, Performed By: Prajith Ravisankar
---
### Sub-todo 4.1.2: Validate LocationForm inputs and improve UX

- Form is styled horizontally and matches the Vite dark theme (bg-[#242424], indigo button, white text).
- Confirmed robust error handling and user feedback in the UI.

### Sub-todo 4.2.2: Complete location list with sidebar layout and interactive features

- Added click-to-pan functionality: clicking a location in the list centers the map on those coordinates.
- Integrated delete functionality with trash icon buttons and proper error handling.
- Added `deleteLocation()` function to locationService.js for DELETE requests to backend.

Date: June 29, 2025, 11:45 PM IST, Performed By: Prajith Ravisankar
---
### UI/UX Layout Improvements and Marker Differentiation
- Restructured App.jsx layout: map and location list side-by-side, form moved below map.
- Improved responsive design with flexbox: desktop shows sidebar, mobile stacks vertically.
- Implemented custom marker colors: green markers for user locations, red markers for disaster events.
- Added ChangeView component to MapView for smooth map panning when clicking locations.
- Enhanced LocationForm: horizontal layout on desktop, all inputs + button in one row.
- Added proper visual hierarchy with dark theme styling and better spacing.
---
### Phase 5: API Resilience & Fallbacks - NASA EONET Integration
- Integrated NASA EONET API (v3) in backend `/api/disasters` route to fetch real-time global disaster events.
- Implemented robust error handling: if EONET API fails or is unavailable, backend automatically falls back to local mock data (`mock-data/disasters.json`).
- No changes required in frontend: data structure matches EONET API, so UI updates seamlessly.
- Verified in browser and terminal: real events display on map, fallback works if API is unreachable.
- This completes Phase 5 core requirements for API resilience and real-world data integration.
---
### Main Todo 8.1: Backend User Authentication Completed
- Created `mock-data/users.json` to store user accounts as an array of objects with username, password, and createdAt fields.
- Implemented `/api/auth/register` route to allow new user registration, ensuring unique usernames and proper error handling for empty or missing files.
- Implemented `/api/auth/login` route to authenticate users against stored credentials.
- Both endpoints return clear success/error messages and are ready for frontend integration.
- Tested registration and login with curl and confirmed correct file updates and responses.

- Updated backend `/api/locations` routes to require username for all operations.
- Each user's locations are now stored and managed in their own file, ensuring complete data isolation.
- Helper functions handle file reading/writing and auto-create files for new users.
- Tested GET, POST, and DELETE endpoints for multiple users and confirmed correct file updates and data isolation.

### Sub-todo 8.3.2: Add authentication flow to App completed
- Updated `App.jsx` to manage login state, persist user in localStorage, and show `AuthPage` if not logged in.
- Integrated logout button and welcome message in the app header.
- Passed username to all location-related components and API calls for user-specific data.
- Verified that authentication flow works end-to-end and user experience is seamless.

Date: June 29, 2025, 9:11 PM IST Performed By: Prajith Ravisankar
---
### Phase 8: User Authentication & Data Isolation
- Implemented user registration and login with `/api/auth` endpoints and `mock-data/users.json`.
- Each user now has their own `{username}-locations.json` file for location storage.
- Backend (`locations.js`) requires username for all location endpoints and isolates data per user.
- Frontend services/components updated to always pass username for location API calls.
- **Critical bug fix:** Removed a conflicting useEffect in `MapView.jsx` that was overwriting locations with an empty array after login. Now, locations display immediately after login for each user.
- Tested with users `john` and `prajith`â€”locations render instantly after login.
- All user-specific data flows confirmed working as of 9:11 PM IST.

**Tested users:**
- `john` (shows 4 locations after login)
- `prajith` (shows 1 location after login)

**Status:**
- All user-specific location and authentication flows are working as intended as of 9:11 PM IST, June 29, 2025.
